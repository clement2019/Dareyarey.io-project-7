 ### A TOOLING WEB-BASED SOLUTION


  For this project i set up five linux distribution servers four of them were an RHEL Linux 8 Operating System. while the last one an Ec2_instances of Ubuntu version 20.04 distribution with all the configurations for free tier set up and it was meant to house the database server. while i also created three Red Hat   Ec2 instance while i named the three of them web 1, web 2 and web3 all partitioned.
 In this project i demonstrated the power of five tier architecture showing that there can be communication between servers.
 
 This project is closely similar to what we did  witrh the wordpress solution This come on the back of that.I now introduced a set of DevOps tools that will help the team
 in day-to-day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring different projects all these in  one go can be seen on the tooling website.
 The task of the project is to make sure the data stored on the databaserver can be seen and fetched into the tooling web solution residing on the web-based server.
 While the NFS ser is for partitioinibg and mounting of servers.
